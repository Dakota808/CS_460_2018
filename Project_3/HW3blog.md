# Homework #3 <br>

## Learing C#
<p>
    So this assignment we are now getting into visual studio code. This application is more desgined for windows computers. So this was based for understanding of how to translate java code into (C#) C sharp code. The important note about these two coding languages are that they have simialr code functions. To see the differences between is type of calls that are issued for certain things such as Java's super class to the base class from C#. It can be translated in a similar way but one has to realize that the code translation between the two are simple to understand.

## Objective
We are to write C# code and be able to translate Java code as well. We were to refactor java code designed to make a binary tree which will take a input and interate through the process until they have met the input value so for example:<br>
```C#
             1
         /       \
        10       11
       /  \     /  \
     100  101 110  111
```
## Java Code
This section we will be looking into the Java code and breif detail of how they function.<br>
Here's what we are looking into:<br>
```html
<ul>
    Node.java
    QueueInterface.java
    QueueUnderflowException.java
    LinkedQueue.java
    Main.java
</ul>
```

### Node.java <br>
<p>
 The Node class from java is simple and easy to understand. But does (T) in the class header mean?Simple it intalizes the node pointer which will hold type.
</p>
<p>
So (T) is a class type which in this case can hold class type objects such as strings, integers, or object types. From this case we use the nodes as pointers to integers.
