## Web application using single database

<p>
This is assignment is in consider a simple basic web application development design using only a single table to create a database. Most people would only think this is simple when I was working on this assignment I had to deal with multiple different issue that weren't related to the assignment. Which in the real world that will happen.

So in this assignment we create the database using sql which visual studio builds a our own (.mdf) which are located in the APP_DATA. From there we build two queries that are designed to do two import task in the database. First is the (up.sql) where we build the tables that holds our data to display inside our web application. After that we have the  down.sql which is used to drop our tables while we are testing to make sure that the database is working.

<p>
This program assignment is difficult due to some difficult problems that occur for no reason sometimes. One example is when the program runs and bin file does not responed to cleaning or rebuilding of the solution. This is how ever the code is simple to understand how it functions.

### Model desgin

<p>The model desgin is simple we build the table in the (mdf) file and then design the code from the model which has to match the table values exactly. This being the main issue I had to deal with make sure the names match with each other. From the there the code gets more interesting where make the values in the view required from the model file itself. But that will only help display and help with the input of the values. </p>

### Controller Design

<p>
The controller desgin is more difficult to understand. We can make this more simple
