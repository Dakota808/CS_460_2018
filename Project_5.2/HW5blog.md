## Web application using single database

<p>
This is assignment is in consider a simple basic web application development design using only a single table to create a database. Most people would only think this is simple when I was working on this assignment I had to deal with multiple different issue that weren't related to the assignment. Which in the real world that will happen.

<p>
So in this assignment we create the database using sql which visual studio builds a our own (.mdf) which are located in the APP_DATA. From there we build two queries that are designed to do two import task in the database. First is the (up.sql) where we build the tables that holds our data to display inside our web application. After that we have the  down.sql which is used to drop our tables while we are testing to make sure that the database is working.
