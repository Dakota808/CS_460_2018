## Ajax application
<br>

<p>
In this assignment we were to build a api application using ajax and connect the web service of giphy to send us stickers that would display each time we have a space between the strings inside of a text box field. This assignment is a simple design for the most part however, there were some unforseen issue that occured in my code. Even now I am still trying to figure out why the error still occurs when all data is correct and there are no issue the connection strings or the code that I built.

### Javascript 
<p>
In this assignment we had to build our own javascript which would only handle the action listening to the users input inside of the text box field to send back a display.
