# Homework #4

## Building the web application

<p>
In this lab were designing the code to build two types of programs. First is the building a converter for miles, where we will convert miles into metric units such as: millimeters, centimeters, meters, kilometers. Then the second task is build a color maker which will create two colors and add the two colors together. However, the main thing to look at for these two fucntions is how we design the view for them as well the controllers for each of them. This is all done in visual studio.
