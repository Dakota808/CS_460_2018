## Auction House Application

<p>
This assignment we are building an application that is using a relation database which holds multiple tables and each are calling each other to display bids of items. Then we will want to know what items are being sold right now and who is selling. The last part, like many online auction houses or shops we want to sell something as well so create a item for acution. We also use json to monitor bids and let you know what is going on.
